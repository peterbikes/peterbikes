<h1>Hi, I'm Pedro <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaueMarques/kaueMarques/master/hi.gif" height="30px"> </h1>

I am a software engineering student based in Portugal.

Currently, I'm studying software engineering at 42 Porto, where I'm learning a wide range of software development concepts, mainly focused on C programming, and I'm excited to continue developing my skills in this area.

In addition to my studies, I'm also a musician and enjoy busking in my free time. I love the creative freedom that music provides, and I believe that my experiences as a musician have helped me to develop a unique perspective on software engineering and problem-solving.

I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, so feel free to reach out to me if you have any interesting projects or collaborations in mind.

Thanks for checking out my profile, and I look forward to connecting with you!
