<h1>Hi, I'm Pedro </h1>

I am a software engineering student based in Portugal.

I study software engineering at School 42, where I'm learning a wide range of software development concepts, mainly focused on C and C++ programming.

I'm also a musician 🎸 and I enjoy busking in my free time. 

Looking forward to connecting with you! 🖥️
